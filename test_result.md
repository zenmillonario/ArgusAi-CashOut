# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Test the optimized login performance for ArgusAI CashOut application. I've implemented several performance optimizations to fix the slow login issue including backend optimizations (asynchronous XP/achievement processing, reduced database queries, comprehensive database indexes, background processing for login rewards) and frontend optimizations (asynchronous Firebase initialization, loading states and progress indicators). Please test the login endpoint /api/users/login with credentials admin/admin123 and measure response times, database performance, background processing, and session management."

Login should now respond in under 2-3 seconds instead of 10+ seconds."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Optimized Login Performance is working exceptionally well. Comprehensive testing results: 1) RESPONSE TIME PERFORMANCE: Average login time is 0.033 seconds (previously 10+ seconds) - a 99.7% improvement! All 5 test logins completed under 0.1 seconds with range 0.021s-0.064s. Concurrent testing of 10 rapid logins averaged 0.027s with all responses under 0.5 seconds. 2) BACKGROUND PROCESSING: Heavy XP/achievement processing successfully moved to background - login responses are immediate while processing happens asynchronously. Backend logs confirm 'FAST LOGIN: User admin logged in with session: ... (XP processing in background)'. 3) DATABASE PERFORMANCE: Verified proper indexes exist - username index and active_session_id index found in users collection (7 total indexes). Database queries are optimized for fast lookups. 4) SESSION MANAGEMENT: Session creation, user status updates, and session invalidation all working correctly. Each login generates unique session IDs and properly updates user online status. 5) FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION: All existing functionality preserved - admin permissions, user status, XP/level data, and all required fields present in responses. The login optimization is a complete success - performance target exceeded by 99x improvement."

Range: 0.017s-0.037s. 2) DATABASE ANALYSIS: Confirmed 410 messages in database (matches user report), average message size 460 characters. 3) NETWORK LATENCY: Baseline API latency 0.007s, message loading overhead only 0.015s (very reasonable). 4) OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE: Different limits tested - limit=5 fastest at 0.009s, limit=200 takes 1.986s but still under 2s threshold. 5) RESPONSE SIZE: 200 messages = 84,236 bytes (84KB), well within acceptable limits. CONCLUSION: The backend API is performing exceptionally well. The user's report of 'several minutes' loading time is likely a frontend/network issue, not backend performance.

The main problems are: 1) While firebase-config.js is properly imported in App.js (line 7), the Firebase service worker is not being registered correctly - App.js is registering '/sw.js' (line 455) instead of '/firebase-messaging-sw.js'; 2) The notificationService.initializeForUser() function is called during login (line 903) and when loading a saved user (line 118), but it's failing because the Firebase service worker isn't registered; 3) The Firebase service worker (firebase-messaging-sw.js) is properly implemented with the correct configuration and WhatsApp-style sound functionality, but it's never loaded; 4) No FCM token registration requests are being made to the backend because the token registration process fails. To fix these issues: 1) Change the service worker registration in App.js from '/sw.js' to '/firebase-messaging-sw.js', or 2) Use the registerServiceWorker function from the notificationService instead of the custom implementation in App.js."

Auto-approval works - no admin approval needed. Trial welcome emails sent successfully. 2) TRIAL USER LOGIN: POST /api/users/login works for trial users with status 'trial'. Trial expiration logic correctly converts expired trials to 'trial_expired' status during login and sends upgrade emails with ARGUS20 discount code. 3) TRIAL ACCESS PERMISSIONS: Trial users have full chat access - POST /api/messages and GET /api/messages work correctly during trial period, same access as approved users. 4) TRIAL EXPIRATION LOGIC: Users past expiration date automatically change from 'trial' to 'trial_expired' status, upgrade emails with ARGUS20 code sent automatically, trial_upgrade_email_sent flag properly set. 5) TRIAL EXPIRED ACCESS RESTRICTIONS: POST /api/messages and GET /api/messages return 403 with upgrade messages for expired trials, but other features (portfolio, practice trading) remain accessible. 6) BACKGROUND TRIAL MANAGEMENT: Periodic cleanup function ready to process expired trials, database consistency verified. Backend logs confirm all functionality working: trial registration ('✨ TRIAL USER REGISTERED'), trial expiration ('⏰ TRIAL EXPIRED'), email notifications, and proper access restrictions. The complete trial system works correctly for the business model - trial registration is instant, trial users get full access for 14 days, after expiration chat is restricted but other features remain accessible, upgrade emails with ARGUS20 code are sent automatically, and all trial management happens automatically in background."

Each login generates unique session IDs (e.g., 9d9c6cf4-feb7-423d-8edc-f58b7f645e47) and properly updates user online status immediately. ✅ FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVATION: All existing functionality preserved - admin permissions correctly identified, user status verified, XP/level data (2722 XP, Level 3) present, and all required fields in responses. ✅ CREDENTIALS TESTING: Successfully tested with specified credentials admin/admin123 as requested. The login optimization is a complete success - the target of 2-3 seconds was exceeded by 99x improvement, achieving sub-100ms response times consistently. Background processing prevents blocking, database indexes ensure fast queries, and all functionality remains intact. This represents a dramatic transformation from a 10+ second login process to a near-instantaneous experience."
