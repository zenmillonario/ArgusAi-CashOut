The AI engineer has transformed the ArgusAI CashOut application from an MVP to a feature-rich trading platform. Initially, critical focus was on perfecting FCM notifications, especially admin-only chat alerts, and resolving a sensitive credential () exposure in Git history. This involved extensive Git manipulation and security awareness. Post-FCM, the work pivoted to significant gamification and social features, including an XP system, achievements, profile customization with banners and pictures, asset allocation visualization, and currently, a follow/unfollow system with optional location. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, particularly with complex frontend JSX errors and browser-specific video autoplay challenges, ensuring a polished user experience while continuously integrating new, complex functionalities.

<product_requirements>
The ArgusAI CashOut application is an AI-powered financial trading platform. The core objective was to build a full-featured application from an MVP, supporting user authentication, real-time WebSocket chat, paper trading, portfolio management (positions, P&L), an admin panel, real-time stock prices, and a multi-tab interface. Specific enhancements included: accurate P&L and low-priced stock handling, chat scrolling fixes, message replies and image pasting, email notifications, last 50 trades history, password management, admin demotion, and WhatsApp-style FCM notifications (admin-only). Recent additions encompass: a 5-second intro video loading screen, a notifications tab (for replies/reactions), heart reactions, a user list sidebar, and enhanced reply previews. The latest requested features are: an Experience Points (XP) system, Achievements, Profile Customization (banners, bios, trading style tags, large profile pictures), an Asset Allocation Wheel, and the ongoing implementation of user following with optional location.

<pending_tasks>
- Test the newly implemented backend for optional location, follow/unfollow functionality, and follower/following counts.
- Implement the frontend integration for the optional location field and the follow/unfollow system, displaying counts on user profiles and lists.
- Develop follow notifications to alert users when they are followed.
- Implement the visual polish and unlock mechanisms for custom themes (based on XP levels).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing social features: **optional location and a follow/unfollow system**. This work is currently at the **backend completion stage**.

On the backend, within , the following modifications were made:
-   The  model was enhanced to include  (an optional string),  (a list of user IDs who follow this user), and  (a list of user IDs this user follows).
-   The  model was also updated to accept the  field for user profile updates.
-   The  endpoint was modified to process and save the user's provided .
-   New API endpoints were introduced:
    -   : Allows a user to follow another user, adding their ID to the target user's  list and the current user's  list.
    -   : Allows a user to unfollow another user, removing their IDs from the respective lists.
-   The  endpoint (used for both public and private profile views) was updated to return the  field, as well as the  and  lists, which implicitly provide the follower/following counts.

The backend changes are committed, and the next logical step would be the frontend implementation of these features, specifically displaying the location, implementing the follow/unfollow buttons, and showing the follower/following counts on the profile pages and user lists.
