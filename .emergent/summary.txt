The AI engineer's work involved enhancing the ArgusAI CashOut platform, initially tackling login optimization, online user display, and implementing a 2-week trial system with administrative tools. The core task in the trajectory shifted to preparing the React app for Google Play Store using Capacitor. The main challenge encountered was a persistent white screen after login on the Android emulator, alongside user requests to change the app name to CashOutAi and use a provided peacock logo as the icon.

The AI engineer systematically investigated the mobile app's configuration, including , , and  files. Key actions included: updating the app name and icon configuration files, generating Android-specific icon sizes from the user's image, implementing network security configurations for HTTPS, and adding extensive debugging logs to . A critical discovery was the mobile app incorrectly connecting to an Emergent preview URL instead of the production backend, which was subsequently corrected in the  and . Despite these fixes, and several rebuilds/syncs, the issues persisted, pointing to Android build system caching problems. The  was consulted twice, confirming build cache corruption and providing nuclear cache clear steps for the user to execute in Android Studio.

The user aims to enhance the ArgusAI-CashOut trading platform, building upon an existing MVP. Initial requirements included restoring core functionality, improving chat UI, implementing achievement/referral systems, expanding notifications, optimizing layout, integrating Microsoft Clarity, and adding intro visuals. The previous AI engineer implemented Email-to-Chat Bridge, Smart Scroll System, and WhatsApp alerts.

Current user-driven development focused on:
1.  **Login Optimization**: Resolve unusually long sign-in times.
2.  **Online Users Bug**: Fix static 9 users online display.
3.  **Deployment Issues**: Address Invalid Host header and Render lockfile errors.
4.  **Trial Membership**: Implement a 2-week auto-approved trial, expiring to Limited Access (no chat), with an upgrade email incentive.
5.  **Admin Tools**: Manage trial users, convert expired trials, and allow rejected users to re-register.
6.  **Email Enhancement**: Correct website URLs, pricing, discount messaging, and add payment buttons to welcome/upgrade emails.
7.  **Historical Chat**: Ensure new users can view past messages.
8.  **Mobile App Deployment**: Port the React app to Google Play Store using Capacitor.
9.  **Mobile App Customization**: Change app name to CashOutAi and app icon to a provided peacock logo.

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer was working on resolving the persistent issues with the Android mobile application: the post-login white screen, and the failure of the app icon and name to update to the user's specified peacock logo and CashOutAi, respectively.

The AI engineer had already:
1.  Corrected the  in  to point to the production backend ().
2.  Updated  to CashOutAi for .
3.  Generated and placed various  icon sizes for the peacock logo into the  directories using a new  script.
4.  Created and linked  to allow connections to the production backend domain.
5.  Updated  with CashOutAi as the app name.
6.  Added extensive debugging logs throughout  and explicitly initialized Capacitor in the component.
7.  Removed adaptive icon XML files (, ) from  and old foreground drawables, as advised by the .
8.  Performed multiple frontend builds and Capacitor syncs.

Despite these actions and detailed instructions to the user to clean and rebuild in Android Studio, the user reported the issues persisted. The  was consulted again, which diagnosed a fundamental Android build system caching issue. The AI engineer's current work concluded with providing the user with detailed Nuclear Cache Clear steps, including invalidating caches in Android Studio, uninstalling the app, performing , and manually deleting build directories, followed by a complete rebuild and fresh installation.
