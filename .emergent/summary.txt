The AI engineer systematically evolved the ArgusAI CashOut platform. Starting from an inherited MVP with functional Email-to-Chat, Smart Scroll, and WhatsApp integration, the focus shifted to critical user experience and core functionality. This included optimizing a slow login process by refactoring XP/achievement calculations and adding database indexing. The persistent 9 users online bug was resolved by implementing stale session cleanup and scheduled maintenance. The Invalid Host header error was addressed, improving application accessibility. A comprehensive 2-week trial membership system was developed, featuring auto-approval, chat restrictions for expired users, and robust admin tools for user management. Email templates were enhanced with accurate pricing, dynamic discount information, and direct payment buttons. Finally, the application was prepared for Google Play Store using Capacitor, with local mobile setup issues addressed. The immediate challenge is a post-login white screen on the Android emulator.

The user aims to enhance the ArgusAI-CashOut trading platform, building upon an existing MVP. Initial requirements included restoring core functionality, improving chat UI, implementing achievement/referral systems, expanding notifications, optimizing layout, integrating Microsoft Clarity, and adding intro visuals. The previous AI engineer implemented a crucial Email-to-Chat Bridge (parsing price alerts to chat), a Smart Scroll System for chat, and WhatsApp alerts via SyncMate.

Current user-driven development focused on:
1.  **Login Optimization**: Resolve unusually long sign-in times.
2.  **Online Users Bug**: Fix static 9 users online display.
3.  **Deployment Issues**: Address Invalid Host header and Render lockfile errors.
4.  **Trial Membership**: Implement a 2-week auto-approved trial, expiring to Limited Access (no chat), with an upgrade email incentive.
5.  **Admin Tools**: Manage trial users, convert expired trials, and allow rejected users to re-register.
6.  **Email Enhancement**: Correct website URLs, pricing, discount messaging, and add payment buttons to welcome/upgrade emails.
7.  **Historical Chat**: Ensure new users can view past messages.
8.  **Mobile App Deployment**: Port the React app to Google Play Store using Capacitor.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Mobile App Post-Login White Screen**: The Android emulator shows a white screen after login; this is a mobile-backend connectivity issue.
-   **Backend URL for Mobile App**: Ensuring the Capacitor app correctly uses the production backend URL instead of .
-   **Admin Panel Frontend Integration**: Frontend admin panel may need updates to reflect new backend capabilities (trial user visibility, conversion, removal).

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer was working on preparing the ArgusAI CashOut platform for Google Play Store deployment using Capacitor. The user successfully opened the app in Android Studio and saw it running on the emulator. However, a critical issue has arisen: **after a successful login with  credentials, the mobile application displays a white screen.**

This indicates a network connectivity problem where the mobile app fails to establish a proper connection with the backend API post-authentication. It is highly probable that the Capacitor-built Android app is attempting to connect to an incorrect or  backend URL after login, rather than the intended production  (). This is the latest reported and unresolved issue requiring immediate attention.

<optional_next_step>
I will investigate why the Capacitor mobile app displays a white screen after login, ensuring it connects to the correct backend URL.
