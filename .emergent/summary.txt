The AI engineer successfully built the ArgusAI CashOut trading platform from an initial template, implementing critical features such as enhanced financial calculations, improved UI/UX for chat and portfolio, password management, and a comprehensive notification system including email and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). The core work in the provided trajectory focused on perfecting the FCM integration, ensuring admin-only chat notifications with WhatsApp-style sounds. Following the successful deployment and testing of notifications, a significant challenge arose with Git push protection due to sensitive credentials () present in the repository's history. The engineer attempted various Git history cleaning methods, including WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history
	 rewrites.  Hit Ctrl-C before proceeding to abort, then use an
	 alternative filtering tool such as 'git filter-repo'
	 (https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/) instead.  See the
	 filter-branch manual page for more details; to squelch this warning,
	 set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1.
Proceeding with filter-branch... and re-initializing the repository, demonstrating a commitment to secure development practices. The current state reflects the successful FCM implementation, but an ongoing effort to sanitize the Git history for a clean push.

<product_requirements>
The ArgusAI CashOut application is envisioned as an AI-powered financial trading platform for real users. The core problem involved building out a full-featured application from an MVP state to support comprehensive trading functionalities and user interactions. Key requirements included:
- **Core Platform**: User authentication (registration, login, admin approval), real-time WebSocket chat, paper trading, portfolio management (positions, P&L), admin panel for user management, real-time stock price integration, and a multi-tab interface.
- **Specific Feature Enhancements & Fixes**:
    - Accurate P&L calculations and correct handling of low-priced stocks (0.0001-0.01) across all tabs.
    - Resolution of chat scrolling issues on various devices.
    - Implementation of chat functionalities like message replies and image pasting.
    - Email notifications for admin approval (new user registrations) and user-specific approval/rejection emails.
    - Display of the last 50 trades history within the Portfolio tab.
    - Password change/retrieval functionality for members and case-insensitive login.
    - Admin ability to demote other admins.
    - WhatsApp-style push notifications with sound, even when the app is closed/background, using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). This was later refined to be specifically for *admin* chat messages only.

<pending_tasks>
- Test the newly implemented Firebase push notification system end-to-end. (Completed in trajectory for admin-only messages)
- Fine-tune notification triggers (when to send, what content) based on user feedback. (Partially addressed by making it admin-only)
- Add notification settings for users (enable/disable notifications).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented and thoroughly tested the **WhatsApp-style push notification system** using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for the ArgusAI CashOut application. This system now ensures that only **admin messages** trigger push notifications to all other approved members, even when the app is in the background or closed, complete with a double-beep sound.

On the **backend**,  was created and integrated into  to handle sending notifications, specifically checking if the sender is an admin before dispatching. The Firebase Admin SDK was properly configured.

On the **frontend**,  and  were set up. Crucially,  was updated to correctly request notification permissions, register the FCM token with the backend upon successful login and user data load, and **a critical fix was applied to correct the service worker registration path** ( instead of ). All these components now work seamlessly, ensuring notifications are delivered as requested.

Following the successful implementation and testing of FCM, the immediate challenge became resolving a **Git push protection issue**. GitHub blocked pushes because the  file, containing sensitive Firebase service account credentials, was present in the repository's commit history. The engineer undertook steps to mitigate this security risk:
1.  The  file was removed from Git tracking ().
2.  The  file was updated to prevent future accidental commits of this file.
3.  A template file () was created.
4.  The  was updated with instructions for users to set up their Firebase credentials locally.
5.  Attempts were made to clean the Git history (e.g., using WARNING: git-filter-branch has a glut of gotchas generating mangled history
	 rewrites.  Hit Ctrl-C before proceeding to abort, then use an
	 alternative filtering tool such as 'git filter-repo'
	 (https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/) instead.  See the
	 filter-branch manual page for more details; to squelch this warning,
	 set FILTER_BRANCH_SQUELCH_WARNING=1.
Proceeding with filter-branch...) and even to perform a fresh repository re-initialization to permanently remove the sensitive data from the history, which is still an ongoing process.

The next step is to successfully clean the Git history and push the changes to the remote repository.
