The AI engineer systematically evolved the ArgusAI CashOut application. Initial efforts focused on resolving environment issues, including Nginx configurations and  discrepancies, to ensure core functionality. Subsequently, significant full-stack features were enhanced: chat UI responsiveness, achievement/referral systems with admin review, and expanded notification capabilities (auto-mark as read, replies, reactions, mentions). UI layout, especially chat and portfolio tabs, was optimized, and Microsoft Clarity was integrated for analytics. Debugging was continuous, addressing React errors, API mismatches, and deployment conflicts. Recent work concentrated on refining the loading screen with a Matrix-style animation, fixing video playback, and implementing a robust Email-to-Chat bot with advanced parsing and filtering. The engineer meticulously debugged achievement triggers (atomic updates for  and ) and confirmed existing notification functionality. The latest task involves troubleshooting the Email-to-Chat bridge's webhook parsing for Zapier-sent data, having already resolved the external URL issue.

<product_requirements>
The user initially sought to revive a corrupted ArgusAI-CashOut trading platform, evolving into specific feature enhancements. Core requirements included:
1.  **Functional Setup**: Clone the repository and ensure full functionality in the preview environment, including proper Nginx routing and environment variable handling.
2.  **Chat UI Redesign**: Enhance chat responsiveness for mobile (sliding panel for user list), ensure message input visibility, fix desktop layout, and improve scrolling.
3.  **Achievement System**: Implement new membership duration achievements and a referral system for cash prizes (up to 00) requiring admin approval.
4.  **Notification System**: Expand notifications for follows, replies, reactions, achievements, cash prizes, and level-ups, with auto-mark as read functionality.
5.  **Layout & UI**: Optimize screen space by compacting headers, adjusting chat/portfolio tab layouts, and using emojis for navigation tabs.
6.  **Analytics**: Integrate Microsoft Clarity for user behavior tracking.
7.  **Intro Visuals**: Replace the intro video on the loading screen with a dynamic, Matrix-style code rain animation featuring a neon-bordered logo and peacock animation.
8.  **Automated Chat Messages**: Implement an Email-to-Chat bridge to parse external price alert emails into concise, formatted chat messages from a bot named CashOutAi Bot, including smart filtering for irrelevant emails.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with  (Python/FastAPI) and  (React.js) directories.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Core FastAPI backend handling user management, chat, achievements, referrals, notifications, and trading. Interacts with MongoDB.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **Achievements**: Fixed atomic updates for  (e.g., , ) using MongoDB's  operator to prevent race conditions and ensure persistence. Modified  and  logic.
        -   **Trading**: Corrected First Blood achievement trigger logic to check for individual trade profitability () instead of overall account profit. Adjusted position lookup logic.
        -   **Notifications**: Confirmed existing functionality for reaction, reply, and follow notifications.
        -   **Bot Integration**: Added new endpoints (, ) for receiving and processing external bot messages. Implemented regex-based parsing for specific price alert email formats. Configured a dedicated CashOutAi Bot user with specific username and display name. Added email filtering logic to prevent spam from appearing in chat.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Main React component managing routing, global state, user authentication, and coordination between different tabs.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored chat layout, integrated  as a separate component, adjusted  logic. Microsoft Clarity initialization and event tracking were added.
-   **/app/frontend/src/ChatInput.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Dedicated component for chat message input, image upload, and send button.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed a critical bug by re-attaching the  event handler to the textarea element (line 142), restoring image paste functionality. Added UX improvements like a green border on paste and a success notification.
-   **/app/frontend/src/LoadingScreen.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Initial loading screen before login.
    -   **Changes**: Overhauled to a Matrix-style design with bidirectional code rain, a rotating neon-bordered logo, and integration of the uploaded peacock animation video. Fixed a React hooks error by reordering  calls. Optimized animation duration, column length, and timing for continuous, seamless code rain. Integrated the  (converted from MOV using FFmpeg) with proper video controls and fallbacks. The overall duration was optimized from 10 to 8 seconds for faster transitions.
-   **/app/frontend/src/NotificationsTab.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Displays user notifications.
    -   **Changes**: No new changes during this trajectory, existing auto-mark as read and display logic were confirmed functional.
-   **/app/frontend/src/UserList.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Displays online/offline users.
    -   **Changes**: No new changes during this trajectory, existing functionality (leading to PublicProfile for follow) was confirmed.
-   **/app/frontend/src/PublicProfile.js**:
    -   **Summary**: Displays a user's public profile and contains follow/unfollow functionality.
    -   **Changes**: No new changes during this trajectory, existing follow functionality (triggering notifications) was confirmed.
-   **/app/frontend/public/peacock-animation.mov** & **/app/frontend/public/peacock-animation.mp4**:
    -   **Summary**: Video asset for the loading screen.
    -   **Changes**: The  file was uploaded by the user, then converted to  for broader browser compatibility using  to ensure it plays correctly on the loading screen.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Email-to-Chat Bridge Parsing**: Refine the email parsing logic in  to correctly extract ticker and price from external email formats, specifically for the test data sent via Zapier, as the current parsing returned Message received but could not be parsed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating an external bot's price alert emails into the chat system, specifically building an Email-to-Chat Bridge. The user explicitly requested to use a dedicated email () and set up a Zapier automation to forward emails to the application's webhook.

The engineer successfully implemented the backend functionality for the bot, creating  and  endpoints in . A CashOutAi Bot user was created, and initial parsing logic for price alert formats was implemented, along with smart filtering for irrelevant emails.

The user then reported an issue with the Zapier setup: . The engineer correctly identified that the previously provided webhook URL was a placeholder and found the actual public URL for the application from  ().

After the user updated Zapier with the correct URL, the Zapier test showed A request was sent... but the chat remained empty. Subsequent manual testing by the engineer revealed the core issue: the webhook was receiving the request (Status 200), but the bot's message parsing logic was failing, returning . The final action was an attempt to fix this parsing logic.
